# Pseudo-Labeling-for-Tree-Counting
Iterative Pseudo-Labeling for Tree Counting in Dense Forests Using Aerial Imagery and Weak Point Annotations


This code is adapted from the GitHub repository at:

The script train.py is executed via main.py.


If your goal after training is solely to predict the center coordinates of trees, you can simply run the script:
test just for predict.py

The final outputs of this workâ€”including the optimized dataset, trained model, and corresponding weightsâ€”are available at:
