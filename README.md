ðŸ“˜ Iterative Pseudo-Labeling for Tree Counting in Dense Forests Using Aerial Imagery and Weak Point Annotations
These codes is adapted from the GitHub repository at:

The script <span style="color:#007acc"><strong><em>train.py</em></strong></span> is executed via <span style="color:#007acc"><strong><em>main.py</em></strong></span>.

If your goal after training is solely to predict the center coordinates of trees, you can simply run the script:
<span style="color:#d38b00"><strong><em>test just for predict.py</em></strong></span>
